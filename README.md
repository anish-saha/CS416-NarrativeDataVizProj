About This Visualiztion:

The World Development Indicators dataset provides many metrics of measuring the growth of countries around the world. However, it is common knowledge that resources are not equally divided amongst countries, and there are people around the world without access to even the most basic amenities, such as shelter, food, electricity, appropriate sanitation, and clean water. This narrative visualization aims to highlight trends in access to water, sanitation, and electricity, for various countries around the world. Throughout this visualization, the user will be guided through a curated data exploration into understanding such trends. Thie martini glass visualization also supports interactive features: users can plot their own line charts to query, analyze, and compare metrics for various other countries in order derive their own insights.
